## How to Submit to the GRaM Blogpost Track
The GRaM Blogpost–Tutorial track follows an **open, GitHub-based submission process** while preserving a double-blind review standard. Submissions are made as pull requests to a public repository and reviewed exclusively via the deployed website.

---

## Review model and anonymity

Submissions **must be anonymized for review**.  
Authors submit their blog posts via a **GitHub pull request** to the [GRaM blog 2026 Repo](https://github.com/gram-blogposts/2026).

Reviewers are instructed **not to inspect git history or repository metadata**, which may reveal author identity. This process is no less double-blind than reviewing papers already available on public preprint servers, a standard practice in machine learning.

Authors who require stricter anonymity may submit from a **new GitHub account without identifying information**, used exclusively for this track.

---

## Submission template and infrastructure

The GRaM blog uses the **al-folio** Jekyll template, with automated builds handled by **GitHub Actions**.

Submissions are validated automatically.  
⚠️ Any deviation from the required file structure will cause the submission to be rejected, so please follow the instructions carefully.

---


## Submission workflow (recommended)

### 1. Fork the repository

Fork the [GRaM blog 2026 Repo](https://github.com/gram-blogposts/2026) repository to your GitHub account.
Do **not** rename the repository and do **not** modify site configuration files.


### 2. Prepare your submission (strictly limited scope)

You must create **exactly one anonymized blog post**, introducing **only** the files listed below.

### Quick submission overvie

#### Required file structure

```text
_posts/
  YYYY-MM-DD-[submission-name].md

assets/
  bibliography/
    YYYY-MM-DD-[submission-name].bib
  img/
    YYYY-MM-DD-[submission-name]/
  html/
    YYYY-MM-DD-[submission-name]/   (optional)
```

The `YYYY-MM-DD-[submission-name]` identifier **must be identical across all files and folders**.
No other files may be added or modified.


### 3. Post format

Each post must:

- Use the `distill` template  
- Include a clear title  
- Include a short abstract in the `description` field  
  (2–3 sentences, **no LaTeX, no links**)  
- Include a table of contents  
- List authors as `Anonymous` during review  

Author information must be added **only after acceptance**, for the camera-ready version.

---

## Local preview (optional)

Authors may preview the site locally before submitting.

If you have Ruby and Bundler installed:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/2026.git
cd 2026
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

The site will be available at:  
`http://127.0.0.1:4000/`

---

## Submitting your pull request

1. Double-check that the post is fully anonymized.
2. Commit **only** the allowed files listed above.
3. Push your changes to your fork.
4. Open a pull request to the **main branch** of the GRaM Blog 2026 repository.
5. The **pull request title must exactly match the submission name**.

All updates must be made by **editing the same pull request**.  
Do not open new pull requests for revisions.

---

## Camera-ready submission

Upon acceptance, authors must:

- De-anonymize the post  
- Add author names, affiliations, and acknowledgements  
- Apply any requested editorial or formatting changes  

Detailed camera-ready instructions will be provided with acceptance notifications.

---

## Further questions

The GRaM Blogpost track is inspired by the ICLR Blogpost track.  
If you encounter technical issues with building or modifying the site, consulting their documentation may be helpful.
