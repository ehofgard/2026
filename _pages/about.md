The Geometric-Grounded Representation Learning and Generative Modelling (GRaM) workshop aims to provide a platform that fosters learning, collaboration, and the advancement of the geometry-grounded methods in machine learning. In this Blogpost-Tutorial track, we intend to encourage transparent discussions and opinions in the field, and make geometric machine learning more accessible.

This blogpost track is directly inspired by the amazing [ICLR blogpost track](https://iclr-blogposts.github.io). :heart:
