GRaM is about taking that geometry seriously!

For the second edition of the GRaM workshop, we invite blog posts that explore how geometric thinking can ground machine learning models: how respecting structure can lead to better representations, more interpretable models, and sharper theoretical insight.

## Key Dates

- **Submission deadline**: Friday, 26 February, 9:00 AoE
  - Any modifications to your blog post, via a pull request on github.
- **Notification of acceptance**: Friday, 11 March, 9:00 AoE
- **Camera-ready merge**: Friday, 11 March, 9:00 AoE


## Why blog posts?

They are a space to:
- explain ideas that do not yet fit neatly into full theorem–experiment pipelines,
- reflect on why a method works (or fails), not just that it works,
- connect distant strands of theory, practice, and intuition,
- articulate open problems, negative results, or conceptual frameworks,
- teach, synthesize, speculate, and provoke!!!!

Scientific progress does not happen only through finalized results. It also happens through clear explanations, honest reflections, and shared intuition. Blog posts foster a more communal kind of science—and we want to make room for that.

## Scope and spirit

We welcome contributions that are broad, creative, and intellectually generous. This includes (but is very much not limited to):

- Explanations of recent papers (including your own)
- Conceptual overviews of geometric ideas in ML
- Connections between geometry and modern large models
- Thoughtful critiques, limitations, or negative results
- Open problems and research agendas
- Tutorials, perspectives, or unifying viewpoints

If it meaningfully relates to geometry and learning, it belongs here.

## Themes of interest

The workshop focuses on geometrically grounded approaches, meaning methods that respect the structure of the problem domain and support geometric reasoning. Topics of interest include:

**Preserving data geometry**
- Preservation of symmetries (e.g. equivariant operators)
- Geometric representation systems (e.g. Clifford algebras, steerable representations Clebsch–Gordan products)
- Isometric or metric-aware latent representations

**Inducing geometric structure**
- Geometric priors via curvature, symmetry, or topology
- Non-Euclidean generative models (e.g. diffusion or flow matching on manifolds)
- Metric-preserving or geodesic-aware embeddings

**Geometry in theoretical analysis**
- Data and latent geometry (data manifolds, statistical manifolds)
- Loss landscape geometry and optimization on manifolds
- Theoretical frameworks from differential geometry, algebraic geometry, or group theory
- Open problems at the intersection of geometry and learning

**Scale and simplicity**
- Geometry at scale: does equivariance still matter for large models?
- Redundancy and minimality: when is geometry essential, and when is it unnecessary?
- Challenging assumptions: negative results and failure modes of geometric methods

Again, this list is not exhaustive. We explicitly encourage submissions that stretch, reinterpret, or question these categories.
